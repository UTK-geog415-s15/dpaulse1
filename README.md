My name is David Paulsen. I started at the University of Tennessee back in the Fall of 2010 originally considering majoring in Computer Science. I had no previous coding experience, but thought that it sounded fairly interesting. My first computer science class showed me two things... One, that I do not have the knack of programming, and two, I also did not have the patience for it. For a little while, I considered majoring in Math, but the lack of career possibilities and barely surviving Calculus III made me look in other directions. I remembered enjoying my one Statistics class in high school, so I decided to take Stat 201 at UT. Since I enjoyed the class and I had already taken some of the required courses, I decided to make Stats my new major. Currently, my thought is to go to graduate school (maybe in applied time series or some type of analytics). Honestly, I am not sure what I hope to do for a potential career. 
  
I enjoy traveling, photography, and music (only listening, I do not play any instrument). One of my favorite trips that I have ever taken was visiting Australia for a couple of weeks. While there, I saw both the urban parts of Australia (Sydney and Cairns) and also got to visit the outback.
